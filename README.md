# VanguardLauncher
A command line Fortnite launcher for most versions of Fortnite. Tested on late Chapter 1 seasons, but Cobalt should also work with Chapters 2 and 3.

## Usage
Compile [Cobalt.dll](https://github.com/Milxnor/Cobalt) and add it to the working directory then run `VanguardLauncher.exe <fortnitePath> <username>` from a terminal.
